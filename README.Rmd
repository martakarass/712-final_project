# Motivation and Overview

How many times you have found yourself spending long, long hours wrapping up an `R` package, polishing and pushing it to CRAN, and realize after that almost nobody downloads it and uses it?

```{r motivation_p1, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '49%'}
# knitr::include_graphics("README_img/motivation_p2.jpg")
# knitr::include_graphics("README_img/motivation_p3.jpg")
```

Hence, you may keep asking yourself: 

- How successful my next R package will be? 
- What makes it successful? 

Here we come, with the **How successful your next `R` package will be?** modeling tool that analyzes your package prototype based on its: 

1. title and description text,
2. meta data,
3. code files content,
4. attached data content,
5. vignettes content

and **predict a number of downloads it will generate** over the time! 

```{r motivation_p2, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '49%'}
# knitr::include_graphics("README_img/motivation_p4.jpg")
# knitr::include_graphics("README_img/motivation_p5.jpg")
```


# Project objectives

1. Develop a predictive model  that takes as an input package's features and predicts a number of downloads it will generate over (a) 3 months, (b) 1 year. 

2. Identify what features of an `R` package derived from package's features such as: title and description text,  metadata, code files content, attached data content, vignettes content etc. are associated with a high number of downloads. 

#  Data sources: examples   

Data sources we used include: 

- `R` packages’ description sites (from CRAN) information,
- `R` packages’ archive’s files (from CRAN) to access information about the package from its 1st release version,
- Utilizing already existing tools to get selected package's statistics (metadata, download numbers etc.)

```{r data_sources, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '49%', fig.cap="Exemplary data source: R package CRAN site"}
knitr::include_graphics("README_img/data_sources_1.png")
# knitr::include_graphics("README_img/data_sources_2.png")
```


# Derived explanatory variables: text mining 

Examples of words (word's cores) in features generated from package's title (*LEFT HAND SIDE*) and package's description (*RIGHT HAND SIDE*): 

```{r Derived_text_mining_1, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '49%'}
knitr::include_graphics("README_img/derived_features_tm_1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("README_img/derived_features_tm_2.png")
```

# Derived explanatory variables: examples 

Examples of words (word's cores) in features generated from package's meta data, code files, attached data content, vignettes: 

```{r Derived_others, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '99%'}
knitr::include_graphics("README_img/derived_features_others.png")
```


# Utilized modeling approaches

We have trained and tuned three different types of predictive model: 

```{r utilized_approaches, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '99%'}
knitr::include_graphics("README_img/utilized_approaches.png")
```

# Results: prediction MSE on test set 

The prediction results of the outcome **logarithm of number of downloads over 1 year time** on the test set are shown below. 

```{r pred_results, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '99%'}
knitr::include_graphics("README_img/pred_results.png")
```

```{r pred_results_comparison, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '99%'}
knitr::include_graphics("README_img/pred_results_summary.png")
```

# Results: explanatory variables 

The top variables in terms of: 

- for linear regression: absolute value of coefficient estimate (note data frame of explanatory variables has been standardized to have mean 0 and variance 1),
- for random forest: variable importance statistic

from modeling the outcome **logarithm of number of downloads over 1 year time** are shown below. 

```{r est_results, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '99%'}
knitr::include_graphics("README_img/est_results.png")
```

# Conclusion

- Random Forest and Support Vector Machine minimize the most MSE in our test dataset.

- The top 5 variables (variable importance rank) capture features related to packages: title ("ggplot"), authors (number), unit testing (files), description ("interface"), data files.

- `R` package developers should include the top features highlighted in our results to increase the ‘success’ of their products.
