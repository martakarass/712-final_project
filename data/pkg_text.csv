httptest,2016-12-31,httptest: A Test Environment for HTTP Requests,Testing and documenting code that communicates with remote servers
    can be painful. Dealing with authentication, server state,
    and other complications can make testing seem too costly to
    bother with. But it doesn't need to be that hard. This package enables one
    to test all of the logic on the R sides of the API in your package without
    requiring access to the remote service. Importantly, it provides three
    contexts that mock the network connection in different ways, as well as
    testing functions to assert that HTTP requests were—or were
    not—made. It also allows one to safely record real API responses to use as
    test fixtures. The ability to save responses and load them offline also
    enables one to write vignettes and other dynamic documents that can be
    distributed without access to a live server.

    simulation of phenotypes under different models, including genetic variant 
    and  infinitesimal genetic effects (reflecting population structure) as well 
    as non-genetic covariate effects, observational noise and additional 
    correlation effects. The different phenotype components are combined into a 
    final phenotype while controlling for the proportion of variance explained 
    by each of the components. For each effect component, the number of 
    variables, their distribution and the design of their effect across traits 
    can be customised. For the simulation of the genetic effects, external 
    genotype data from a number of standard software ('plink', 'hapgen2'/
    'impute2', 'genome', 'bimbam', simple text files) can be imported. The final 
    simulated phenotypes and its components can be automatically saved into .rds

Rodam,2016-10-05,Rodam: Wrapper Functions for 'ODAM' (Open Data for Access and Mining)
Web Services,'ODAM' (Open Data for Access and Mining) is a framework that implements a simple way to make research data broadly accessible and fully available for reuse, including by a script language such as R. The main purpose is to make a data set accessible online with a minimal effort from the data provider, and to allow any scientists or bioinformaticians to be able to explore the data set and then extract a subpart or the totality of the data according to their needs. The Rodam package has only one class, 'odamws', that provides methods to allow you to retrieve online data using 'ODAM' Web Services. This obviously requires that data are implemented according the 'ODAM' approach , namely that the data subsets were deposited in the suitable data repository in the form of TSV files associated with  their metadata also described  in TSV files. See <http://www.slideshare.net/danieljacob771282/odam-open-data-access-and-mining>.

loon,2017-07-26,loon: Interactive Statistical Data Visualization,An extendable toolkit for interactive data visualization and exploration.
metaplot,2017-04-17,metaplot: Data-Driven Plot Design,Designs plots in terms of core structure.  See 'example(metaplot)'.
 Primary arguments are (unquoted) column names; order and type (numeric or not)
 dictate the resulting plot.  Specify any y variables, x variable, any groups variable,
 and any conditioning variables to metaplot() to generate density plots, boxplots, 
 mosaic plots, scatterplots, scatterplot matrices, or conditioned plots. Use multiplot() 
 to arrange plots in grids. Wherever present, scalar column attributes 'label' and 'guide' 
 are honored, producing fully annotated plots with minimal effort. Attribute 'guide' 
 is typically units, but may be encoded() to provide interpretations of categorical 
 values (see '?encode').  Utility unpack() transforms scalar column attributes to row 
 values and pack() does the reverse, supporting tool-neutral storage of metadata along 
 with primary data. The package supports customizable aesthetics such as such as reference 
 lines, unity lines, smooths, log transformation, and linear fits. The user may choose
 between trellis and ggplot output. Compact syntax and integrated metadata promote workflow 
 scalability.
nanotime,2016-12-16,nanotime: Nanosecond-Resolution Time for R,Full 64-bit resolution date and time support with resolution up

fDMA,2017-07-10,fDMA: Dynamic Model Averaging and Dynamic Model Selection for
Continuous Outcomes,Allows to estimate dynamic model averaging, dynamic model selection and median probability model. The original methods are implemented, as well as, selected further modifications of these methods. In particular the user might choose between recursive moment estimation and exponentially moving average for variance updating. Inclusion probabilities might be modified in a way using 'Google Trends'. The code is written in a way which minimises the computational burden (which is quite an obstacle for dynamic model averaging if many variables are used). For example, this package allows for parallel computations and Occam's window approach. The package is designed in a way that is hoped to be especially useful in economics and finance. Main reference: Raftery, A.E., Karny, M., Ettler, P. (2010) <doi:10.1198/TECH.2009.08104>.

    standard evaluation adapter methods for important common 'dplyr' data manipulation tasks.
    In addition the 'seplyr' package supplies several new "key operations
    bound together" methods.  These include 'group_summarize()' (which
    combines grouping, arranging and calculation in an atomic unit),
    'add_group_summaries()' (which joins grouped summaries into a 'data.frame'
    in a well documented manner), 'add_group_indices()' (which adds
    per-group identifiers to a 'data.frame' without depending on row-order),
    'partition_mutate_qt()' (which optimizes mutate sequences), and 'if_else_device()'
    (which simulates per-row if-else blocks in expression sequences).
frequencyConnectedness,2017-05-02,frequencyConnectedness: Spectral Decomposition of Connectedness Measures,Accompanies a paper (Barunik, Krehlik (2018) <doi:10.1093/jjfinec/nby001>) dedicated to spectral decomposition of connectedness measures and their interpretation. We implement all the developed estimators as well as the historical counterparts. For more information, see the help or GitHub page (<https://github.com/tomaskrehlik/frequencyConnectedness>) for relevant information.
grf,2017-07-04,grf: Generalized Random Forests (Beta),A pluggable package for forest-based statistical estimation and inference.
    GRF currently provides methods for non-parametric least-squares regression,
    quantile regression, and treatment effect estimation (optionally using instrumental
    variables). This package is currently in beta, and we expect to make continual
    improvements to its performance and usability.
parallelDist,2017-06-06,parallelDist: Parallel Distance Matrix Computation using Multiple Threads,A fast parallelized alternative to R's native 'dist' function to
    calculate distance matrices for continuous, binary, and multi-dimensional
    input matrices, which supports a broad variety of 39 predefined distance
    functions from the 'stats', 'proxy' and 'dtw' R packages, as well as user-
    defined functions written in C++. For ease of use, the 'parDist' function
    extends the signature of the 'dist' function and uses the same parameter
    naming conventions as distance methods of existing R packages. The package
    is mainly implemented in C++ and leverages the 'RcppParallel' package to
    parallelize the distance computations with the help of the 'TinyThread'
    library. Furthermore, the 'Armadillo' linear algebra library is used for
    optimized matrix operations during distance calculations. The curiously
    recurring template pattern (CRTP) technique is applied to avoid virtual
    functions, which improves the Dynamic Time Warping calculations while
    the implementation stays flexible enough to support different DTW step
    patterns and normalization methods.
revengc,2017-08-18,revengc: Reverse Engineering Summarized Data,Decoupled (e.g. separate averages) and censored (e.g. > 100 species) variables are continually reported by many well-established organizations (e.g. World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Bank, and various national censuses).  The challenge therefore is to infer what the original data could have been given summarized information.  We present an R package that reverse engineers decoupled and/or censored count data with two main functions.  The cnbinom.pars() function estimates the average and dispersion parameter of a censored univariate frequency table.  The rec() function reverse engineers summarized data into an uncensored bivariate table of probabilities.
smapr,2016-10-05,smapr: Acquisition and Processing of NASA Soil Moisture Active-Passive

sparsepp,2016-12-30,sparsepp: 'Rcpp' Interface to 'sparsepp',Provides interface to 'sparsepp' - fast, memory efficient hash map. 
    It is derived from Google's excellent 'sparsehash' implementation.
    We believe 'sparsepp' provides an unparalleled combination of performance and memory usage, 
    and will outperform your compiler's unordered_map on both counts. 
    Only Google's 'dense_hash_map' is consistently faster, at the cost of much greater 
    memory usage (especially when the final size of the map is not known in advance).

HEMDAG,2017-08-11,HEMDAG: Hierarchical Ensemble Methods for Directed Acyclic Graphs,An implementation of Hierarchical Ensemble Methods for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The 'HEMDAG' package can be used to enhance the predictions of virtually any flat learning methods, by taking into account the hierarchical nature of the classes of a bio-ontology. 'HEMDAG' is specifically designed for exploiting the hierarchical relationships of DAG-structured taxonomies, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) or the Gene Ontology (GO), but it can be also safely applied to tree-structured taxonomies (as FunCat), since trees are DAGs. 'HEMDAG' scale nicely both in terms of the complexity of the taxonomy and in the cardinality of the examples. (Marco Notaro, Max Schubach, Peter N. Robinson and Giorgio Valentini (2017) <doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1854-y>).

datasauRus,2017-05-09,datasauRus: Datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen,The Datasaurus Dozen is a set of datasets with the same summary statistics. They 
             retain the same summary statistics despite having radically different distributions.
             The datasets represent a larger and quirkier object lesson that is typically taught
             via Anscombe's Quartet (available in the 'datasets' package). Anscombe's Quartet
             contains four very different distributions with the same summary statistics and as 
             such highlights the value of visualisation in understanding data, over and above
             summary statistics. As well as being an engaging variant on the Quartet, the data
             is generated in a novel way. The simulated annealing process used to derive datasets 
             from the original Datasaurus is detailed in "Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating 
             Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing"

    objects in R. Specifically designed to show differences between two sets of
    data in a useful way that should make it easier to understand the differences,
    and if necessary, help you work out how to remedy them. Aims
    to offer a more useful output than all.equal() when your two data sets do not
    match, but isn't intended to replace all.equal() as a way to test for equality.

   'Spark' 2.0.0 and above) in a reliable "generic" fashion (generic meaning
   user code works similarly on all such sources, without needing per-source
   adaption).  Due to the fluctuating nature of 'dplyr'/'dbplyr'/'rlang' 'APIs' this package
   is going into maintenance mode.  Most of the 'replyr' functions are already 
   done better by one of the non-monolithic replacement packages: 'wrapr', 'seplyr', 'rquery',
   or 'cdata'.

Eagle,2017-08-28,Eagle: Multiple Locus Association Mapping on a Genome-Wide Scale,An implementation of multiple-locus association mapping on a genome-wide scale. 'Eagle' can handle inbred and  outbred study populations, populations of arbitrary unknown complexity, and data larger than the memory capacity of the computer. Since 'Eagle' is based on linear mixed models, it is best suited to the analysis of data on continuous traits. However, it can tolerate non-normal data. 'Eagle' reports, as its findings, the best set of snp in strongest association with a trait. For users unfamiliar with R, to perform an analysis, run 'OpenGUI()'. This  opens a web browser to the menu-driven user interface for the input of data, and for performing genome-wide analysis.

    management strategy evaluation (MSE) framework to simulate all aspects of 
    management: population dynamics, manager observation of populations, manager
    decision making, and stakeholder responses to management decisions. The 
    newly developed generalised management strategy evaluation (GMSE) 
    framework uses genetic algorithms to mimic the decision-making process of 
    managers and stakeholders under conditions of change, uncertainty, and 
    conflict. Simulations can be run using gmse(), gmse_apply(), and
    gmse_gui() functions.

GPrank,2016-10-27,GPrank: Gaussian Process Ranking of Multiple Time Series,Implements a Gaussian process (GP)-based ranking method
    which can be used to rank multiple time series according to their
    temporal activity levels. An example is the case when expression
    levels of all genes are measured over a time course and the main
    concern is to identify the most active genes, i.e. genes which
    show significant non-random variation in their expression levels.
    This is achieved by computing Bayes factors for each time series
    by comparing the marginal likelihoods under time-dependent and
    time-independent GP models. Additional variance information from
    pre-processing of the observations is incorporated into the GP
    models, which makes the ranking more robust against model
    overfitting. The package supports exporting the results to
    'tigreBrowser' for visualisation, filtering or ranking.

  <doi:10.1080/00031305.1999.10474456> Bayesian data mining method for the
  market basket problem. Calculates Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) and
  quantile scores from the posterior distribution using the Gamma-Poisson
  Shrinker (GPS) model to find unusually large cell counts in large, sparse
  contingency tables. Can be used to find unusually high reporting rates of
  adverse events associated with products. In general, can be used to mine any
  database where the co-occurrence of two variables or items is of interest.
  Also calculates relative and proportional reporting ratios. Builds on the work
  of the 'PhViD' package, from which much of the code is derived. Some of the
  added features include stratification to adjust for confounding variables and
  data squashing to improve computational efficiency. Now includes an
